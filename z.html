                    <h2>Terms of Service</h2>

                    <h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
                    <p>
                    By inviting or using <strong>Z+ Security</strong> (“the Bot”), you agree to these Terms of Service. 
                    If you do not agree, please remove the bot from your server.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. Service Description</h3>
                    <p>
                    Z+ Security provides Discord server protection features such as antinuke, moderation, and automated security responses.
                    Features may change or update at any time.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. Proper Usage</h3>
                    <p>
                    You agree not to use Z+ Security for any illegal, abusive, or malicious activities. 
                    Misuse of the bot may result in denial of service and a ban from future usage.
                    </p>

                    <h3>4. Liability</h3>
                    <p>
                    The developers of Z+ Security are not liable for any damages or losses arising from the use or inability to use the bot.
                    The service is provided “as is.”
                    </p>

                    <h3>5. Updates to Terms</h3>
                    <p>
                    We may update these terms at any time without prior notice. Continued use of the bot after updates means you accept the new terms.
                    </p>

                <!-- Privacy Policy Section -->
                <section id="privacy">
                    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

                    <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
                    <p>
                    Z+ Security only stores the minimal data required for its functionality, such as server IDs, role IDs, and user IDs linked 
                    to server configurations. We do not collect personal information like emails or passwords.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. How We Use the Data</h3>
                    <p>
                    Collected data is used exclusively to operate features like whitelisting, logging, and security actions.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. Data Retention & Deletion</h3>
                    <p>
                    Data is stored only while the bot is active in a server. Server owners can request deletion of all stored data 
                    by contacting us through our support server.
                    </p>

                    <h3>4. Data Security</h3>
                    <p>
                    Reasonable measures are taken to secure stored data, but no system is completely immune to vulnerabilities. 
                    Use the bot responsibly and limit its permissions when possible.
                    </p>

                    <h3>5. Contact</h3>
